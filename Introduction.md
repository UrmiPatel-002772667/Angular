# Angular
Angular is a **TypeScript-based open-source web application framework** developed and maintained by Google. It is used to build single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic web apps with high performance and a structured architecture.

## 💡 Key Features of Angular:

| Feature                             | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧱 **Component-Based**              | The app is built using reusable components.                                           |
| 🔁 **Two-Way Data Binding**         | Automatically synchronizes data between UI and logic.                                 |
| 📦 **Built-in Modules**             | Includes tools for HTTP, routing, forms, and more—no need for extra libraries.        |
| 📐 **Dependency Injection**         | Improves code modularity and testing.                                                 |
| 🚀 **Ahead-of-Time Compilation**    | Converts TypeScript to optimized JavaScript during build time for faster performance. |
| ⚙️ **CLI (Command Line Interface)** | Helps generate components, run tests, and build the app with ease.                    |

## 🧠 Angular vs AngularJS

| Angular (v2+)        | AngularJS (v1.x)               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| TypeScript           | JavaScript                     |
| Component-based      | Controller/Scope-based         |
| Better performance   | Slower for large apps          |
| Maintained by Google | Obsolete (end of life in 2021) |
